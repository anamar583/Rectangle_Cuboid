Python Assignment: Rectangle and Cuboid Analysis


This repository contains Python scripts for analyzing geometric shapes based on given points loaded from a `points.txt` file.

## Description

- **rectangle.py**: This file calculates whether three given points loaded from the `points.txt` file can form a rectangle. It also determines if the fourth point in the file lies within the rectangular area or outside.

- **rectangular_square.py**: This file differentiates between two types of rectangles: rectangular and square. It analyzes the input points to determine which type of rectangle is formed.

- **cuboid_3D.py**: This script takes four 3D points loaded from the `points.txt` file and calculates whether these points can form a cuboid. It then checks if a fifth given point can be inside the cuboid.

- **cuboid_nD.py**: Similar to `cuboid_3D.py`, this script also analyzes points from the `points.txt` file but works for an arbitrary number of dimensions. It determines whether the given points can form a cuboid and checks if a fifth given point can be inside the cuboid.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone [link text](https://github.com/anamar583/rectangle_cuboid.git)
2. Navigate to the cloned directory:
   cd Rectangle_Cuboid
3. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
4. Prepare the `points.txt` file with the coordinates of the points.
5. Run the desired Python script (e.g., `rectangle.py`, `cuboid_3D.py`) to analyze the geometric shapes based on the given points.
